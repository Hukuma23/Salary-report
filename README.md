## Salary survey reports

An anonymous salary survey has been traditionally conducted annually since 2015 among European IT specialists in Germany. Below, you will find an in-depth comparative analysis of the aggregated anonymised responses from voluntary participants.

**Purpose:** to learn a competitive value of a skillset for IT specialists depending on years of experience, position, level, etc.

**Audience:** most respondents are expats living in Germany and working either for Germany or abroad (remote).
