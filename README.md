### 👥 Audience 

Since 2015, an anonymous salary survey has been conducted annually among European IT specialists, with a particular focus on Germany. From 2021 year, the scope was refined even further, dedicating the survey exclusively to Germany. This shift was driven by the significant economic differences across European countries — such as variations in taxation and cost of living — that heavily influence local salary benchmarks. Most respondents are expats living in Germany and working either for Germany or abroad (remote).
